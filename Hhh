Perfect — here is a clean, no-nonsense step summary, exactly in the order it should be done. This is implementation-ready and easy to follow.

SunSystems Compiled Forms – Step-by-Step Summary

Objective: India support team must be technically incapable of seeing EU sensitive data


---

Step 1: Prepare Access Structure

Create two user groups:

EU_FINANCE

IND_SUPPORT


Create two menu profiles (EU / India)

Ensure India users have NO form designer access

Raise a change ticket (audit evidence)



---

Step 2: Identify Sensitive (PII) Fields

List all sensitive fields (bank, address, tax, contact, free text)

Map each field to:

Form name

Table name


Freeze this list → GDPR evidence



---

Step 3: Clone Standard Forms

Open standard form (e.g. SSCUST)

Save As → SSCUST_IND_NO_PII

Never modify standard forms directly



---

Step 4: Remove Sensitive Fields

In the India form:

Delete sensitive fields completely (preferred)

If delete not possible:

Visible = FALSE

Enabled = FALSE

TabStop = FALSE


Do not use profiles, roles, or personalization



---

Step 5: Compile the India Form

Compile SSCUST_IND_NO_PII

Verify:

No personalization

No runtime edits


Result: fields cannot be re-enabled



---

Step 6: Separate Menu Assignment

EU menu → points to standard form

India menu → points to compiled form

Same function, different technical objects



---

Step 7: Lock Inquiries & Drilldowns

Repeat Steps 3–6 for:

Customer / Supplier inquiries

Transfer Desk

Drill-downs

Lookups


(No PII should appear anywhere)


---

Step 8: Test Worst-Case Scenarios

Test as:

India user

Admin user

Power user

User with DB access


Confirm:

No PII visible

No PII exportable

No personalization possible



---

Step 9: Protect During Upgrades

Maintain a Form Register

After upgrades:

Re-import

Re-compile

Re-test




---

Final Outcome (Key Message)

> India support users are technically prevented from accessing EU personal data.
Access is impossible by system design, not by policy.
